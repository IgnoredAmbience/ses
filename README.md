  Abstract                 = {We present an operational semantics of the Secure ECMAScript (SES) language. We extend Separation Logic with a backpointer operator to permit reasoning about the reachability in the object graph whilst maintaining local reasoning. We define inference rules in the extended logic for SES. Finally, we prove the correctness of the Membrane design pattern.},
