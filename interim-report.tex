  In recent years with the development of the web, JavaScript has become an
  increasingly-intensively used language. At its invention and for a
  considerable length of time, JavaScript was only used for simple tasks such as
  form validation
  
  The modern nature of web-programming

  is that multiple different programs from different sources may be loaded and
  executed in a single environment. This combination of different code poses
  some interesting problems regarding code-correctness and security. JavaScript
  provides no means to isolate different modules of code from one another, all
  data stored in memory is accessible to any code loaded on the page, which must
  be implicitly trusted.

  Secure ECMAScript is a proposed extension to the ECMAScript 5 specification
  that allows programs to be executed within a restricted context. Restricted
  execution will ideally permit fine-grained control over the permissions
  untrusted executing code has. It is possible for unrestricted code to interact
  with code under restricted execution, it is in this situation that it is
  envisaged that lapses in the encapsulation could occur inadvertantly.
  % could still expand details on mixed execution - examples?

  The language's structure already poses some interesting problems for
  researchers producing formal models of programming languages due to its memory
  structure.  A formal logic for ECMAScript 3 has been recently developed by
  researchers at Imperial College. This project aims to extend this program
  logic to effectively model the restricted execution support proposed by the
  Secure ECMAScript language specification. This will permit proofs asserting
  that the language constructs are secure, and that programs written using the
  restricted execution construct do not accidentally leak private data or
  permissions to untrusted code, especially during interactions between two
  contexts.

  The formal logic for ECMAScript 3 is based upon Separation Logic, an extension
  of Hoare Logic which permits efficient reasoning about data contained within
  heaps by splitting the heap into smaller discrete portions. However, to reason
  about restricted execution, we need to reason about the \emph{entire}
  heap. The first aim of the project is to extend Separation logic with a
  backpointer operator to allow reasoning about which objects point to an
  object of interest.

  Using this new operator, we then aim to produce semantics for the restricted
  \texttt{eval()} operation.

  Finally, we prove the correctness of a contract host algorithm which permits
  two mutually suspicious parties to execute an agreed contract on a mutually
  trusted third-party.

\chapter{Background}
\section{Hoare Reasoning}
  This style of reasoning about the functionality and correctness of computer
  programs was first presented in his 1969 paper ``An Axiomatic Basis for
  Computer Programming''\cite{Hoare1969Axiom}, the principles presented were
  based on earlier work by Floyd\cite{floyd1967assigning} for flowchart
  representations of programs, and by others in other branches of mathematics;
  Hoare developed the style of the reasoning to fit textual representation of
  programs.

  Hoare's reasoning depends on the basis that commands used in programming
  languages should be well-defined and thus the consequences of a computer
  program should be determinable directly from the program's text by deductive
  means. Program proofs are deduced through the application of inference rules
  to sets of axioms.

  The main contribution of the paper was to introduce the notation, now known as
  a Hoare triple:
    \[ \{P\} C \{Q\} \]
  $P$ and $Q$ are logical assertions and $C$ is some command or program. The
  triple is interpreted by Hoare as ``if the assertion $P$ is true before
  initiation of a program $C$, then the assertion $Q$ will be true on its
  completion.'' Other interpretations of triples are possible, as will be shown
  later.

  The axioms selected for use in the reasoning alter the semantics of the system
  being reasoned about. Hoare exemplifies this by presenting axioms that apply
  to arithmetic under all sets of integers, followed by three alternative axioms
  that describe different semantics for overflow in sets of finite integers.

  A number of axioms and inference rules are universal or common to nearly all
  imperitive languages, Hoare presents four of these:
  \begin{display}{}
    \stateaxiom{(Assign)}
    {\tr{P[f/x]}{x := f}{P}} \qquad

    \staterule{(Consequence)}
    {\tr{P'}{C}{Q'} \quad P \impl P' \quad Q' \impl Q}
    {\tr{P}{C}{Q}} \\
    \\
    \staterule{(Iteration)}
    {P \quad \tr{B}{S}{P}}
    {\tr{P}{\textbf{while } B \textbf{ do } S}{\lnot B \land P}} \qquad

    \staterule{(Composition)}
    {\tr{P}{C_1}{Q} \quad \tr{Q}{C_2}{R}}
    {\tr{P}{C_1; C_2}{R}}
  \end{display}

  The consequence and composition rules are straight-forward. The iteration rule
  is also reasonably simple once it is noted that the $P$ term is the loop
  invariant. The assignment axiom is the most subtle of the set when not taken
  in the context of a proof. The axiom asserts that the post-condition will hold
  if the \emph{precondition} if the precondition has the variable replaced by
  the assigned value. This axiom makes more sense if it is considered to be used
  whilst reasoning backwards. For example, to prove $\tr{\true}{r := x; q :=
  0}{x = r + y \times q}$:

  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    $\{\true \impl x = x + y \times 0 \}$ & Axiom \\
    $\tr{x = x + y \times 0}{r:=x}{x = r + y \times 0}$ & Assignment \\
    $\tr{x = r + y \times 0}{q:=0}{x = r + y \times q}$ & Assignment \\
    $\tr{\true}{r:=x}{x = r + y \times 0}$ & Consequence \\
    $\tr{\true}{r:=x; q:=0}{x = r + y \times q}$ & Composition\\
  \end{tabular}

  It is noted that proofs in this format are long and tedious, but it is
  possible to derive more general rules from the given ones which would somewhat
  reduce the length of these proofs. This is now the generally accepted method
  of presenting proofs in Hoare's system, so the above proof could also be
  presented as follows:

  \begin{tabular}{l}
    $\{\true\}$ \\
    $\{x = x + y \times 0\}$ \\
    $\ r:=x$ \\
    $\{x = r + y \times 0\}$ \\
    $\ q:=0$ \\
    $\{x = r + y \times q\}$
  \end{tabular}

  Indeed, in his 1971 paper~\cite{Hoare1971proof}, Hoare presents a proof in
  such a style for the non-trivial \textsc{Find} algorithm.

  %Hoare closes his paper by reinforcing the need for formal proof and
  %specification of computer programs and languages.
