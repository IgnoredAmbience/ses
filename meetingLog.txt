Weds 6th Feb, 2pm
* Worked through defns for SL/PL
  * Very rusty, even after just a week... Worrying
* Badly behind on OpSem - promised for Friday.

Friday 8th Feb, 5pm
* Discussed prepared opsem draft
* Clarify scope prototype chain confusion
  * Prototype chains don't exist for activation records, only for normal objects
  * Will need to recurse at l_g, but is last object, soln to null out
    prototypes.
  * ES5 restriction means no with, but we can still root the scope chain at a
    user object
* this
  * Consider scope prototype chain differences, should be ok as-is, since we
    should hit our first protottype at the global.
* G had a more traditional semantics in view, cf: while, my option to build on
  existing work.
  * Scope chain vs global variable
* reval
  * Consider scope initialisation more carefully:
      reval("var x; alert(x)", {x:1, alert:alert})
    returns undefined, or 1? Does it differ from
      reval("x; alert(x)", {x:1, alert:alert})
  * Do we need to pre-declare variables on new scope?
    * Is it merely for implementation-security, or mirroring JS spec?
* freeze
  * Simple annotation of objects possible, add checks to writing rules
  * Also implement def in syntax/semantics, as lang. impl using for is too messy
* Stop worrying about implementation
